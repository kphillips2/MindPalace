To check if a door can be placed on a room:

float[] results =
RoomCollision.canRoomDoorBePlaced(center of the room, index of the door to be created);

To check if a door can be placed on a corridor:

float[] results =
RoomCollision.canCorridorDoorBePlaced(center of the corridor, angle of the corridor,
index of the door to be created);

If the results array is NULL -> Door cannot be placed due to there not being a room
on the other side or due to a picture being in the way

Contents of the results array (if not null) ->
results[0] = xcor of the center of the room/corridor on the other side of the wall
results[1] = ycor ""
results[2] = zcor ""
results[3] = index of the door for the room/corridor on the other side of the wall
results[4] = 0 if the space on the other side of the wall is a room, 1 if corridor

If you choose to build the door, update save file with code like this:
------------------------------------------------------------------------

SaveLoad.currentLoci.openRoomDoorAt(center of the room you're building off of, index of door);
(If you're building off of a corridor, change function to openCorridorDoorAt instead)

if(results[4] == 0)
{
SaveLoad.currentLoci.openRoomDoorAt(new Vector3([results[0],results[1],results[2]), 
results[3]);
}
else
{
SaveLoad.currentLoci.openCorridorDoorAt(new Vector3([results[0],results[1],results[2]), 
results[3]);
}
